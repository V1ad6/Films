# HELLO THERE

This is my second pet-project I posted on my GitHub profile.

This app shows my skills in usage of HTML, CSS ( with preprocessor 'SCSS'), TypeScript, React, Redux, Redux-Thunk and even Figma.

It's just a site with a list of movies. You can get info about each movie from this site, you can sort and filter the list and you can search for some movie in this list.

That's all for now, but I will make some new features for this app soon. 

Thank you for reading this and I hope you'll like this little project.
